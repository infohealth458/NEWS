        <h1>UK Immigration White Paper — Health & Skilled Worker Rules</h1>

          <h2>Summary — Key Immediate Changes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Overseas recruitment for care workers ended:</strong> Adult social care roles (Care Worker and Senior Care Worker) are no longer open to new overseas sponsorship applications. <br><em>(Transitional arrangements provided — see details below).</em></li>
            <li><strong>Skilled Worker rule change:</strong> The minimum skill level returned to degree-level (RQF Level 6); many medium/low-skilled roles are no longer eligible for sponsorship unless on a temporary shortage list.</li>
            <li><strong>Salary thresholds increased:</strong> General minimum salary thresholds and Skilled Worker salaries were updated (with higher pay requirements), taking effect around 22 July 2025.</li>
            <li><strong>Restrictions on dependents:</strong> New applicants for lower-skill roles (RQF 3–5) may no longer bring dependents.</li>
            <li><strong>Settlement (ILR) change proposal:</strong> Proposals suggest extending the residence requirement for settlement from 5 years to 10 years (with some possible exceptions).</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="card"><strong>Quick action for workers / employers:</strong> If you work in the care sector or are a sponsoring employer, you will need to review workforce planning, improve pay/conditions, and create retention strategies for existing in-UK staff.</p>

          <h3>Detailed Points</h3>

          <h4>1) Care workers — End of overseas recruitment</h4>
          <p>
            The White Paper confirmed that overseas recruitment for care worker and senior care worker roles would close. Employers can no longer sponsor new overseas applicants in these roles. Those already in the UK are offered transitional protections (visa extensions and in-country switching for a limited duration).
          </p>

          <h4>2) Timing — when rules took effect</h4>
          <p>
            The White Paper was published in May 2025; rule changes and “Statements of Changes” instruments made them operational from <strong>22 July 2025</strong>. Transitional protections (e.g., extensions/switching) are commonly available until <strong>22 July 2028</strong>.
          </p>

          <h4>3) Skilled Worker: Skill level and salary</h4>
          <p>
            The Skilled Worker route now requires a minimum skill level of RQF Level 6 (degree). Previously eligible RQF 3 roles were largely removed. Salary thresholds were increased, requiring employers to offer higher pay for sponsorship. Some exemptions or temporary shortage list arrangements apply for medium-skilled roles.
          </p>

          <h4>4) Dependents and family</h4>
          <p>
            New applicants in lower-skilled roles are restricted from bringing dependents. Existing visa holders with dependents in the UK may retain protections, but the new rules apply to future applications.
          </p>

          <h4>5) Settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain)</h4>
          <p>
            Policy proposals include extending the general qualifying period for settlement (ILR) from 5 to 10 years, with some exemptions for highly contributive workers. Both employers and migrants need to consider the long-term impact of this change.
